# State-Space Model and Error Dynamics Derivation

## Original State-Space Model

The original state-space model of the system is given by:

```math
\begin{align}
\dot{x} &= Ax + Bu + B_f f(x,d(t)) \\
y &= Cx
\end{align}

for what each variable means check the article

## Error equation

e(t) = x(t) - r(t)
\dot{e}(t) = \dot{x}(t) - \dot{r}(t)

substituting \dot{x}(t) from the state space model:

\dot{e}(t) = (Ax + Bu + B_f f(x,d(t))) - \dot{r}(t)

then we get: 

\dot{e}(t) = A(e + r) + Bu + B_f f(e + r,d(t)) - \dot{r}(t)

Expanding the terms gives us the error dynamics:

\begin{align}
\dot{e}(t) &= Ae(t) + Bu(t) + B_f f(e + r,d(t)) + A r(t) - \dot{r}(t) \\
y_e(t) &= Ce(t) + Cr(t)
\end{align}

"Given

a state-space model with matrices A, B, and C, control input u, and disturbance function f depending on the state x and a disturbance d(t), derive the error dynamics equations when the error e(t) is defined as the difference between the system's state x(t) and a reference trajectory r(t). Please show all the steps involved in the derivation."

Make sure to replace the matrices A, B, and C, the control input u, and the disturbance function f with the specific values or functions from your system when you provide them to ChatGPT.
