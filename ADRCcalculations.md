# State-Space Model and Error Dynamics Derivation

## Original State-Space Model

The original state-space model of the system is given by the following equations:

`x_dot = Ax + Bu + Bf * f(x, d(t))`
`y = Cx`

For what each variable means check the article.

## Error Equation

`e(t) = x(t) - r(t)`
`e_dot(t) = x_dot(t) - r_dot(t)`

Substituting `x_dot(t)` from the state-space model:

`e_dot(t) = (Ax + Bu + Bf * f(x, d(t))) - r_dot(t)`

Then we get:

`e_dot(t) = A*(e + r) + B*u + Bf * f(e + r, d(t)) - r_dot(t)`

Expanding the terms gives us the error dynamics:

`e_dot(t) = A*e(t) + B*u(t) + Bf * f(e + r, d(t)) + A*r(t) - r_dot(t)`
`y_e(t) = C*e(t) + C*r(t)`

"Given a state-space model with matrices A, B, and C, control input u, and disturbance function f depending on the state x and a disturbance d(t), derive the error dynamics equations when the error e(t) is defined as the difference between the system's state x(t) and a reference trajectory r(t). Please show all the steps involved in the derivation."

Make sure to replace the matrices A, B, and C, the control input u, and the disturbance function f with the specific values or functions from your system when you provide them to ChatGPT.
