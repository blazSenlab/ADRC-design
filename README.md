# This repository is used for saving notes and matlab files for project of designing ADRC controller

Project goals (TODO: update goals as it goes):
1. First step
- Reproduce simulation results from the article about ADRC in inverted pendulum (done)
- design linear mathematical model of device from the lab
- Milestone: get similar simulation results to the ones in given article about model

2. Second step
- fine tune model with measurments from real time device
- Milestone: get 95% match between real life and simulation results

3. Third step (can be done before 2nd step)
- Create ADRC control based on the article for model developed in First step
